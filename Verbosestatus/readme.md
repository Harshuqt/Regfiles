# What is Verbose status in windows?

Verbose status in Windows is a setting that displays more detailed messages during startup, shutdown, logon, and logoff. This can be helpful for troubleshooting problems with these processes, as it can provide more information about what is happening behind the scenes.

For example, if your computer is taking a long time to start up, verbose status messages might show you which drivers or services are causing the delay. Or, if your computer is crashing during shutdown, verbose status messages might show you which process or service is causing the crash.

Once you have enabled verbose status, you will see more detailed messages during startup, shutdown, logon, and logoff. These messages will appear in the lower-left corner of the screen.

Please note that enabling verbose status can have a slight impact on performance. If you are not experiencing any problems with startup, shutdown, logon, or logoff, you may want to disable verbose status to improve performance.
